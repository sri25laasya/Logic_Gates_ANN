# Logic_Gates_ANN
Logic gates are an important concept if you are studying electronics. These are important digital devices that are mainly based on the Boolean function.
Logic gates are used to carry out logical operations on single or multiple binary inputs and give one binary output.
In simple terms, logic gates are the electronic circuits in a digital system.

#ANN
Artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that consists of several processing elements that receive 
inputs and deliver outputs based on their predefined activation functions.
